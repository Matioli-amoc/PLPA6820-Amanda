Toc: true -> Transform the sections into an summary with links.

toc_float -> Transform the sections into an summary in the side of the html file.


This is an example of R code:
```{r R code Example, include=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
#{r R code Example, include=TRUE, echo=FALSE} I can use it to display options
#We can set chunks to show up in the resulting document by setting some options like include = TRUE or FALSE
#this is R code
summary(mtcars)
```

This is how to include figures
```{r Include Figures}
library(ggplot2)
data("mtcars")
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg))+
  geom_point()

```

We can include code and plots.
```{r}
data("mtcars")
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +
  geom_smooth(method = lm, se = FALSE) +
  geom_point(aes(color = wt)) +
  xlab("Weight") + 
  ylab("Miles per gallon") +
  scale_colour_gradient(low = "forestgreen", high = "black")
```

Blockquotes are written after >, e.g.,

I don`t think i did this right :/
```{r}
#> "I thoroughly disapprove of duels. If a man should challenge me,
#  I would take him kindly and forgivingly by the hand and lead him
#  to a quiet place and kill him."
